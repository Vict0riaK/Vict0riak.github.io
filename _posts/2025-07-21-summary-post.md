## Peer response post by Thiago Contardi 

I completely agree; In lower-income countries, Industry 5.0 has potential to make a significant impact. By implementing a human-centric approach within advanced technologies, such as AI, it can improve transparency, sustainability, and social responsibility. For example, studies highlight how digital solutions and circular logistics can empower emerging economies to participate in higher-value supply chains, breaking the cycle of exploitation (Sharma et al., 2024).

Turning to fashion industry and the considerable amount of data leaked in recent years. New measures could be applied to mitigate the problem. Maybe new regulations that require encrypting all personal data may enhance security and reduce liability.

In short, Industry 5.0 offers a blueprint: it empowers socially responsible supply chains, opens pathways for economic development in poorer countries, and provides the technological tools to secure consumer trust in data handling.

## Summary Post 

Building on Thiago’s point I believe that GDPR and personal data encryption  can help to tackle the problem of data breach. However, since GDPR is applicable to Europe mostly it is not always helpful for other countries if they  do not cooperate with European Union. 

Fashion industry is driven by the demand and since the values of society change it seems like the topic of sustainability gets more attention (Bringe, 2023). Sustainability can mean a variety of things and in the context of fashion we will define it as “creating and consuming clothes in a “sustained” way that protects the environment and those producing the clothes” (Bringe, 2023). This awareness of sustainability drives brands to embrace new practices and some are very successful at it, especially Levi’s (Bringe, 2023). The popularity of fast fashion trend is changing and some companies encourage users to wear their clothes for lifetime and offer repair like Patagonia (Bringe, 2023). I think this is a fantastic start when such campaigns create even more awareness among consumers about natural materials, processes of production, etc. I wish that companies like Apple would embrace this vision and offer for example repair of their products instead of updated version. This would be much more sustainable. 

Transparency is required to build trust in the brand. As we know it is very easy to lose reputation for any company so only true change can make a difference. Implementing and embracing Industry 5.0 seems like a fantasy but when I see that such industries as fashion are open to change it gives me hope. Luckily the researchers defined the meaning and applicability of Industry 5.0 also in practice.  (Ghobakhloo et al., 2022) state that sustainability includes data sharing and transparency among others and this I hope will break the cycle of exploitation we are witnessing right now.
