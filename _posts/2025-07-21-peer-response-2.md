## Initial Post by Opeyemi 

The integration of artificial neural networks (ANNs), particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, into writing tasks presents a complex interplay of benefits and risks across various domains, from administrative functions to creative endeavours.

Benefits

In administrative contexts, AI writers enhance efficiency by automating routine tasks such as drafting emails, summarising documents, and generating reports. This automation allows human workers to allocate more time to strategic and creative responsibilities.

AI tools can serve as catalysts for inspiration, helping writers to overcome writer's block and explore new ideas. A study by the University of Exeter found that AI-generated prompts can boost writers' creativity, particularly for those with lower inherent flair, although it may lead to less diverse storylines (The Guardian, 2024).

Risks

Despite these advantages, significant ethical and legal concerns arise. Content produced by AI has the potential to reinforce biases found in training data, producing results that support false information or stereotypes. Hutson (2021) highlights instances where GPT-3 produced racist and sexist content, reflecting the prejudices embedded in its training corpus.

Furthermore, issues of authorship and intellectual property are brought up by the use of AI in content creation. The U.S. Works created exclusively by AI without human authorship are not eligible for copyright protection, according to clarification from the Copyright Office (U.S, 2023) Copyright Office. This uncertainty may give rise to ownership disputes in court as well as possible abuse of AI-generated content.

In journalism, the deployment of AI-generated personas, as seen in Belgian editions of magazines like Elle and Marie Claire, where AI-produced articles were attributed to fictitious authors, has sparked ethical debates about transparency and authenticity in media (The Times, 2025).

Conclusion

While AI writers offer substantial benefits in efficiency and creative support, they also pose significant ethical and legal challenges. It is imperative to establish clear guidelines and oversight mechanisms to ensure that the use of AI in writing upholds standards of accuracy, fairness, and accountability. Ongoing discourse and policy development are essential to navigate the complexities introduced by AI in the realm of written communication.

## Peer response 2  

Hi Opeyemi,

Thanks a lot for sharing the Elle and Marie Claire story! I am wondering how it happened that the publisher figured out that the stories are AI generated. Indeed, the problem I see here is with trustworthiness. As LLMs tend to hallucinate and are basically, a black box, the content generated by LLMs could be flawed (Shojaee et al., n.d.). Apart from that the reputation and credibility of Elle and Marie Claire magazines can significantly suffer due to such actions. Readers do expect a high-quality content from the authors which is well-researched, thoughtful and ethical (Nexibeo, 2025).
However, it seems that “It's very hard for off-the-shelf AI models like GPT and Claude to emulate contemporary literary authors' styles” since it is trained mostly on “non-literary prose”. Some authors use it to organize their thoughts and boost creativity (Veltman, 2024) What I found fascinating that authors have learned to fine-tune LLMs to more literary style by feeding it their own books (Veltman, 2024). Some experiment with LLMs by teaching them their own style (Veltman, 2024). However it is not enough to train LLM on one’s own writing and using more literary material poses a question of plagiarism which is indeed not yet solved. This remind me of revolutionalry perspective of industry 5.0 about unlocking human potential using AI as a tool (Kraaijenbrink, 2022). Hopefully the industry will embrace it along with corresponding IP legislation soon.
