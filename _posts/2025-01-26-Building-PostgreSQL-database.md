## How I have built my database

I have created 4 tables using CREATE TABLE function. Below is the example for customers table.

This code was used to create the Table Customers. On the image below you can see four tables: Charging stations, Customers, Energy Providers and Transactions.

In order to test reports I generated random values using INSERT function, like this:

In order to check station utilization I have pulled a report. Below is the code along with the output.
