## The role of industry 4.0 and 5.0 in fashion 

One of the industries that I can think of that will be profoundly affected by Industry 5.0 is fashion. Starting with collaboration of designers with AI to implement the vision using such technologies as computer-aided design (CAD), laser cutting (Iarocheski, n.d.), the supply chain, inventory management, demand prediction and its influence (Iarocheski, n.d.) - the changes are mind-blowing. Technologies can enable designers to be more creative by streamlining processes that used to take plenty of time. This is very exciting news since it may unlock human potential even further and that is the human-centric perspective that industry 5.0 adds in comparison with industry 4.0 which only focuses on productivity (Nousala et al., 2024)

     While Fashion inspires me, it also disappoints me because it is the second industry after oil that harms the environment (Iarocheski, n.d.) As i lived in India, I have learned that often child labour is used for embroidery which is very common in expensive garments. It is also a common knowledge that the working conditions in the countries where the clothes is produced are far from perfect (Iarocheski, n.d.). Industry 5.0 approach may facilitate more transparency when it comes to supply chain and production stages, enable further individual personalisation of items and hopefully make the industry more sustainable. This would revolutionise fashion industry.

     When it comes to cybersecurity "The fashion sector is particularly vulnerable, as retailers there hold a trove of personal and financial information about customers" (Thomas, 2024). There are numerous data breaches in fashion industry. Such corporation like VF corporation, Forever21, Shoe Zone, Levi's, JD Sports etc. suffered data breached which exposed personal and financial data of thousands of customers (Thomas, 2024). Indeed, apart from financial impact and disrupted deliveries - the brands and company reputations suffer significantly due to the lost trust which leads to the loss of the customers. The fashion retailers need to ensure the smooth process of shopping for the consumer, and this elevates the use of technology along with increase risks (Thomas, 2024).
