## Initial post by Thiago Contardi 

Today’s organisations operate within complex ecosystems, where digital technologies handle everything from production lines to security defences.

While Industry 4.0 introduced automation and connectivity at unprecedented scale, its shortcomings underscore the need for more resilient, human-centred systems.

Metcalf (2024) argues that Industry 5.0 builds on these lessons by embedding human collaboration, sustainability and operational resilience into automated processes. In cybersecurity, for example, it means that AI-driven tools must work within experts, ensuring that critical updates and configuration changes undergo human review rather than blind deployment 

One specific incidents have underscored the societal scale of our dependency on these systems and their far-reaching consequences: 

On 19 July 2024, CrowdStrike released a routine content configuration update for its Windows sensor that inadvertently contained malformed data immediately crashing into “Blue Screens of Death” (CrowdStrike, 2024). Within hours, banks, hospitals and other crucial services found their systems unprotected. By 29 July 2024, most cases were back online, but the direct financial impact was huge and the customers’ confidence was deeply shaken.

This case reveals the over-dependency paradox: as systems become ever more interconnected, the fallout from a single component failure can cascade across digital and physical infrastructures. Industry 5.0 must therefore blend automation with active human oversight, chaos-engineering exercises and decentralised architectures so that neither a misconfigured update nor an unexplained blackout can incapacitate entire services (KPI, 2023).

## Response to Thiago Contardi 
Hi Thiago,

I was shocked when I learned about the CrowdStrike incident. It is unthinkable that the software could be so tightly integrated to Operation System that its routine update malfunction can turn a computer into a “brick” (Murray, 2024). When the cybersecurity leader company encounters such issue - the effect is indeed global affecting various sectors like aviation and healthcare (Murray, 2024). Luckily at home we are using McAfee or built-in Microsoft Windows software hence we are not under risk. Unfortunately there was no easy and fast fix to this problem at a time and the IT teams struggled to tackle it facing enormous time pressure (Murray, 2024)

Indeed, the crisis management framework should be thought through considering such incidents and hopefully this can make organizations more resilient (Rieth, 2024) What the industry 5.0 highlights is that although AI enables humans to be more productive and creative, but it cant act instead of humans in case of such crucial events. For example, running such update on digital twin in sandbox environment could have brought attention to the risk. Decentralising the model could also help to prevent malfunction of the update. Right now the update is sent centrally to all the clients, however it could also go through staggered deployment or clients could receive it locally which would make it more resilient and in accordance with Industry 5.0 principles (Nousala et al., 2024) Industry 5.0 also encourages human authority in automated decision-making processes. In the case of CrowdStrike, the update could have been double checked before final deployment at scale. I could not agree more with your point that the human oversight is essential.
