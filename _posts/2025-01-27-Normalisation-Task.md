## How I normalised the dataset: demonstration of 1NF, 2NF and 3NF. 

Please have a look at the dataset I need to normalise here. 
[DBD_PCOM7E Table.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18564688/DBD_PCOM7E.Table.xlsx)

The fist normal form [1NF] is achieved by elimination of repeated groups and ensuring atomic values. We can see that initially the data is grouped by student name and there are multiple values in course column.

To achieve [1NF] I restructured data to make sure there is only one value per cell. Like this.
