## Essay
In this essay I would like to reflect on mandatory assignments I have undertaken during ML module using Gibb’s reflection cycle (McLeod, 2025).

The first mandatory task was a collaborative discussion about industry 4.0 and 5.0. I used an example of fashion industry since it is something that inspires me – it is a feast for my eyes. I admire the creativity! At the same time, it is the industry that produces a lot of waste by becoming “fast” and fostering consumers to change clothes after wearing it a few times. I find collaboration of designers and AI inspiring. It can really unlock human creativity and potential. The perspective of making this industry sustainable and society oriented is encouraging. Luckily some brands like Levi’s and Patagonia are already leading in the topic of sustainability and encourage lifelong use of their items as well as offering repair (Bringe, 2023)
Engaging in conversation with my peers was a wonderful journey. I have learned about the CrowdStrike example used by Thiago and it helped me to understand better the depth of Industry 5.0 approach. I learned that Crowdstrike has a one push centralised global update that could have been decentralised which could have prevented the global scale of Blue Screen of Death screens which happened. Other measures could be digital twin simulation and keeping a human in the loop and this is the value of perspective which industry 5.0 brings. (Nousala et al., 2024)
Another example was about Post office scandal where the Fujitsu accounting software in the UK post office was trusted blindly, and many employees were arrested due to the “fraud” which they have never committed. Unfortunately, some people committed suicide as a consequence of the depts they were forced to pay and accusations. The interplay of various factors such company reputation, lack of transparency and awareness with regards to software functionality, absence of independent audit and absence of human-centricity has all resulted in a disaster with fatal consequences. I have learned that industry 5.0 is truly revolutionary in its perspective since it aims to serve the society versus reputation of organizations and its interests (cite paper on post office disaster in UK). 
The next group discussion was about LLMs and I have learned that the shortcomings of LLMs could be tackled if the reasoning is developed however right now unfortunately the effect is observed only on the tasks of medium complexity and also it is not easily transferrable tasks (cite apple paper). So LLMs are pretty much a black box and hallucinations remain. LLMs responses are neither trustworthy nor reliable and we should strive to make them so. The reason it is important is because LLMs influence our beliefs and decisions since more and more people and organizations use them for the same. 
Another task was a group work on Airbnb dataset. Despite disagreements in the group, we managed to complete the task. I learned that it is sometimes wiser to go with the flaw when most of the group members are on a different page and that collaborating via chat has a lot of limitations like misunderstandings. 
My favorite assignment happened to be about convolutional neural networks. I enjoyed understanding the concept and I would love to work going forward on object identification. I also managed to transfer the concept of maxpooling into my personal life. I went to the archeological museum, and I felt that the amount of information is overwhelming. I have applied the maxpooling strategy and only read fist sentences of each paragraph. I managed to get a bigger picture and felt inspired. While studying CNN we start with how our vision works and how we identify the features and objects. Same way we can learn from algorithms and apply the techniques to our own learning. 

The collaborative posts were valuable since they encouraged me to learn and reflect on incidents and their implications. Examples helped me connect theory with real-world consequences. Studying CNNs was a highlight since I found the concept and its implementation interesting and useful for future job. 
The CrowdStrike and Horizon examples revealed how centralized systems that lack of ethical principles, and absence of human oversight can cause catastrophic failures. This reinforced the importance of Industry 5.0 approach, which emphasizes resilience, decentralization, and human-centricity (Nousala et al., 2024). The LLM discussion deepened my understanding of AI limitations, especially in reasoning and bias. Shojaee et al. (n.d.) discovered that LLMs collapse on highly complex reasoning tasks, hallucinate and can’t be trusted (Shojaee et al., 2025). These insights bring up the importance of regulations around AI when it comes to ethics, responsibility and Intellectual Property questions.  
This module helped me bridge theory and practice. I gained such skills like TensorFlow, Pytorch, Cluster Analysis, Logistic Regression, Image classification using CNNs, and Transfer Learning while also learning about the importance of social responsibility, communication, and collaboration. The group work experience, though emotionally taxing, reminded me of the importance of adaptability and self-care in professional environment.
Going forward I plan to communicate clearer when it comes to group work with team members from various backgrounds, enhance my technical skills in transfer learning and Tensorflow, keep in mind the importance of ethics, sustainability and transparency in my work and apply the principles of Industry 5.0 if I have a chance. I would also like to develop my interpersonal skills along with technical.
