## Scraping the Adzuna job search website

I have performed web scraping using Python to extract job listings with the key word "Data Scientist" and used Selenium to handle dynamic content loading. Extracted key details include: Job Title, Company Name and Location. To parse HTML content I used Beautiful Soup.
