## Initial post by Kieron 

The Postmasters' Scandal stands as a stark example of how technological failures, coupled with severe institutional shortcomings, can lead to widespread injustice.
<!--more-->
At its heart was the Horizon IT system, developed by Fujitsu, which was deployed by the Post Office starting in 1999. Designed to manage transactions, Horizon contained fundamental flaws that incorrectly reported financial shortfalls in branches. Instead of investigating these systemic errors, the Post Office relentlessly pursued legal action against hundreds of its own sub-postmasters, accusing them of theft and fraud (Wallis, 2021).

This tragic saga highlights critical failures in IT governance and ethical leadership. The Post Office's unwavering belief in Horizon's infallibility, despite mounting evidence and the desperate pleas of innocent individuals, demonstrates a catastrophic disregard for due process and basic human dignity. The scandal exposes the dangers of an organisational culture that stifles dissent, prioritises reputational protection over truth, and punishes whistleblowers. The human cost has been immense, with lives ruined, reputations destroyed, and families torn apart. This case serves as a powerful reminder of the profound responsibility organisations hold when implementing technology, and the devastating consequences when accountability, transparency, and a commitment to justice are absent (Aldred, 2022).

Crucially, the Postmasters' Scandal serves as a cautionary tale for the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). As 4IR technologies like AI, big data, and advanced automation become increasingly integrated into every facet of society and business, the potential for catastrophic system failures and algorithmic injustice escalates. The Post Office's blind faith in Horizon, an early form of widespread digital integration, mirrors the potential for over-reliance on complex 4IR systems without adequate human oversight, ethical frameworks, or robust testing. The scandal underscores the urgent need for critical scrutiny, transparent accountability, and strong ethical considerations to prevent a future where more sophisticated, yet potentially flawed, automated systems could cause even greater societal harm. It compels us to consider how such miscarriages of justice can be prevented in the future, particularly as our reliance on interconnected digital infrastructures deepens.

## Response to Kieron 
Hi Kieron,

Thank you for bringing up the Horizon scandal. It is difficult to believe right now that back in 90s the faith in technology was so strong that it was difficult to shake. Luckily the victims were finally heard and got a compensation. I am wondering whether independent audits took place regularly at that time. Perhaps the post office wanted to protect its reputation and admitting the fault would inevitably result in claims. So too many factors overlapped and lead to this scandal I assume. Ideally from the perspective of Industry 4.0 implementation of automation, data analytics, and interconnected systems could have helped to identify the system flaws sooner (Nousala et al., 2024) Industry 4.0 elevates quality control by enabling monitoring and reducing errors by integrating various sources of information, using cloud computing and embedded software to analyse data (What Is Industry 4.0?, n.d.)

However, industry 4.0 has a heavy emphasis on technologies while Industry 5.0 offers stronger advantages by keeping human in the loop before jumping into conclusion about superiority of the system. Industry 5.0 emphasizes societal value and contribution to the well being of employees on the top of technology and consists of three pillars: human-centric, resilient, and sustainable (Kraaijenbrink, 2022) If post office saw serving customers as their mission as well as adding value to the customer and perceiving it as a competitive advantage – the scandal probably would not even happen. Sustainability principle means that companies would strive to “make this world a better place” (Kraaijenbrink, 2022). I really hope that this vision will become appealing to the companies and that it will be embraced.
